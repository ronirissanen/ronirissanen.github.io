                                I created this game in Unity for a game programming course. It is currently my favorite completed project. It's simple but everything works pretty well.

                                The game is called Shotgun Dash. It's named after the moving mechanic in the game. The player moves by shooting. The recoil of the gun kicks the player character backwards. If you run out of ammo, you will inevitably die. The green enemies have a chance to drop ammo and health pickups when killed.

                                All of the assets in the game are modeled by me. The terrain is randomly generated by instantiating the assets into a grid. At the time I didn't know that you could activate Unity's enemy pathing generation from code so that is something I would like to implement if I were to realease the game.

                                'Bouncy Wizard' is my first game ever. Everyone on my class had to create a Flappy Bird clone in Unity with a partner as their first project. My partner during the project was Juuso 'Jupi' Halonen. The differentiating factor between our game and Flappy Bird is the shooting mechanic. In our game the player character, wizard, has to break some of the obstacles with fireball projectiles to get past them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The project was started in fall of 2019 and it was finished a bit after Christmas break. We didn't reach all specs we had set for the project. Both of us improved rapidly in programming skill so we agreed that coding the project properly would require too much effort to be worth it over just starting a new project, so the project came to an abrupt end. Everything we implemented works but there were grander plans we never got to see through.
