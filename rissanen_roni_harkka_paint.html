                                One of the first digital pieces I did completely without ms paint. I drew a rough sketch on paper first and then did the lines and colors in GIMP. Drawing in GIMP is very similar to Paint - bad. I should learn Photoshop.

                                Inspired by the movie Goodtime, instagram user artwithbryn and a song by BADBADNOTGOOD called Can't Leave the Night.

                                I came up with the design for these characters about five years ago. However since the idea for them is to mix proper anatomy with geometric shapes my art skills were not up to the task back then. I returned to the concept in early 2019.

                                I usually start to hate my drawings quite quick but this piece from 2016 still holds up. I think it was originally done for high school art class. At least I remember submitting it to get the course done.

                                The idea behind this one was to mix the maskot of Iron Maiden and Mickey Mouse. At the time I was experimenting with punching holes through my drawings and putting photos in the created space. I ended up using a photo of a rose for this one which made it a lot gruesome than at first intended.

                                Lines were done in paint and the photograph was added in the background using GIMP.
