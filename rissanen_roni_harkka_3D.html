                                The last project on our modeling course was to create a character model and rig some animations to it. The suggested character was Lara Croft and I chose to just go with the recommendation since I had no projects that needed character models at the moment. However I might use a tweaked version of this model in my next project.

                                I tried to tone down the ridiculousness of the original character's proportions but she is still ended up way too skinny. Where are her organs? I think the project looks a lot better than my previous work thanks to the mistakes I learned from during the car project. Characters are my preferred subject when it comes to art so I really enjoyed this project.

                                The second 'bigger' project in our modeling course was a car model. I was only strating to learn 3DSMAX at this time so I made lots of mistakes. The model has too many unintentional polygons which I created trying out different tools. This makes the car look wrinkly. This was also the first time I created UV maps for a model. I really hate the end result but I learned a lot during the project.
